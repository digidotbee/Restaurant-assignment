const storyTime = `Stepping up to order at Uncle John's Smokehouse Foodtruck is like
stepping into the technicolor mind of Uncle John himself.  The Northern Delaware 
native who has infused his entire being 
into the craft of whole-hog barbecue. 
The old ice cream truck turned barbecue heaven, open since August 2015, 
features the rustic hand-painted signs of roasted meats offered and chalkboard menu items is 
the perfect backdrop for Uncle John's smoky delights. Son of a 
pig farmer and pitmaster of the South Carolina barbecue tradition, 
Uncle John incorporates regional delights into the food truck's repertoire including 
Scrapple hash and chicken bog in addition to his Eastern North Delaware 
style whole hog barbecue with its vinegary red-pepper flecked mop, 
while his farm fresh seasonal sides utilize the properties of wood smoke, fire, 
and hog fat as law. Pair that with a killer Scotch menu and the musical stylings of friend and musician, Stefanie Seskin, 
 and youâ€™ve got a food destination of the nth degree.`
